<objective>
Final responsive QA pass and demo polish — verify every page works on mobile and desktop, fix any layout issues, and ensure the demo is presentation-ready for state executives.

Purpose: The demo must look polished on any device an executive might use (laptop, tablet, phone). This plan catches responsive issues, visual bugs, and UX rough edges.
Output: Fully responsive, polished demo at vanderdev.net/ecosform ready for executive presentations.

  <name>Task 1: Responsive audit and fix pass</name>
  <files>src/index.css, src/components/Sidebar.jsx, src/components/Layout.jsx, src/pages/AgreementPage.jsx, src/pages/WorkflowPage.jsx, src/pages/DashboardPage.jsx, src/components/form/AgreementForm.jsx</files>
  <action>
Run the dev server locally and systematically audit every page at three breakpoints: mobile (375px), tablet (768px), desktop (1280px+).

Check and fix these common issues:
1. **Sidebar:** Does mobile hamburger work? Does overlay dismiss on link click? Is RoleSwitcher usable on mobile?
2. **Agreement Form:** Do form fields stack properly on mobile? Is the track selector readable? Do access group checkboxes wrap cleanly?
3. **Security Content:** Do collapsible sections work on touch? Is text readable at mobile width?
4. **Signature Block:** Does the typed-name input and certification checkbox layout work on mobile?
5. **Workflow Page:** Do workflow cards stack on mobile? Is the signature timeline readable?
6. **Dashboard Page:** Do stat cards stack on mobile? Does the department table scroll horizontally or wrap? Does the audit trail table work on small screens (horizontal scroll or card layout)?
7. **DemoBanner:** Does it display correctly at all widths? Is dismiss button accessible?

Fix any issues found. Common Tailwind responsive fixes:
- Add `overflow-x-auto` to wide tables
- Use `grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-4` for stat cards
- Ensure `min-w-0` on flex children to prevent overflow
- Check `text-sm` / `text-xs` sizing on mobile

Do NOT redesign anything — only fix layout breaks and overflow issues. Keep changes minimal and targeted.

Dev server running. Each page manually checked at 375px, 768px, and 1280px+ (use browser DevTools responsive mode).
No horizontal scroll on any page at any breakpoint.
All interactive elements (buttons, inputs, checkboxes, dropdowns) are touch-accessible.

  <done>
All pages render correctly at mobile (375px), tablet (768px), and desktop (1280px+). No overflow, no broken layouts, all interactions work.

  <name>Task 2: Deploy responsive fixes and final verification</name>
  <files>Remote VPS deployment</files>
  <action>
1. Commit any responsive fixes made in Task 1.

2. Push to GitHub:
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```

3. Pull and rebuild on VPS:
   ```bash
   ssh vps "cd /root/Automation/ECOS && git pull && docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d --build"
   ```

4. Wait for container to rebuild and restart (check with `docker ps`).

5. Verify the production deployment matches local fixes:
   ```bash
   curl -s https://vanderdev.net/ecosform/ | head -c 200
   ```
  </action>
  <verify>
VPS container rebuilt with latest code.
`curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" https://vanderdev.net/ecosform/` returns 200.

  <done>
Production deployment updated with all responsive fixes. vanderdev.net/ecosform serves latest build.

  <how-to-verify>
    1. Open https://vanderdev.net/ecosform/ on desktop browser
    2. Walk through demo flow:
       a. As Employee: Fill form, select access groups, submit, sign
       b. Switch to Manager: View pending, sign
       c. Switch to Admin: View dashboard, sign remaining, check audit trail
    3. Open on mobile (phone) or use DevTools mobile emulation:
       a. Verify sidebar collapses to hamburger
       b. Verify form is usable with touch
       c. Verify dashboard tables are scrollable
    4. Check: No visual glitches, no console errors, all data persists
    5. Confirm: This is ready to show to executives
